## README FILE for /VertexDetector

The folder ~/VertexDetector contains a **simulation and reconstruction** program for a vertex detector.
The **author** is  Lorenzo de Cilladi.
The program was written as exam project for the course "Tecniche di Analisi Numerica e Simulazione", held by Professor Massimo Masera.

Simulation:
```
~/VertexDetector/Sim/
```

Reconstruction:
```
~/VertexDetector/Reco/
```

Scripts for analysis:
```
~/VertexDetector/Analysis/
```

Geometrical features of the detector and a few utils:
```
~VertexDetector/Geometry/
~VertexDetector/Utils/
```

Each one of the above-mentioned folders contains a **README** file, which guides the user through the usage and the understanding of scripts and files.

Both the simulation and the reconstruction programs are object-oriented. The header files for the **classes** are grouped in the folders ~/Sim/include/ and ~/Reco/include/, while the implementation files can be found in ~/Sim/src/ and ~/Reco/src/.
The **documentation** of the classes can be accessed opening the file ~/docs/index.html through a browser, e.g.
```
~/OldSovietSchool/VertexDetector/docs$ firefox index.html
```
In the html documentation, the above-mentioned README files for Sim, Reco and Analysis can also be accessed.
